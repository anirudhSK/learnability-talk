See the comments in template.tex for more information about how to use
the template.  (You should probably copy it to another name first.)
Presently, it only supports making posters for the Dreyfoos fourth-floor
hallway displays.  The finished poster is 30.5 inches wide and 55 inches
tall, centered on media measuring 42" W x 60" H.

For assistance, send mail to <help@csail.mit.edu>.  We would appreciate
hearing about any improvements or modifications you make.  (We are
particularly interested making this template useful for traditional
conference posters at A0 or A1 sizes in addition to the odd size supported
by this package.  This mostly involves changing the way dimensions are
handled to depend on the paper size.)

This template is based on the work of Rob Clark for Edinburgh
