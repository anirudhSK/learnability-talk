% This is a template for a CSAIL poster to be displayed in the
% Dreyfoos 4 hallway.  It may be extended in the future to support
% other poster formats, so the options shown below are mandatory.
%
% To format this poster, use the following steps (yes, they are all
% necessary):
%
% latex myposter		N.B.: not compatable with pdftex!
% latex myposter
% dvips -o myposter.ps myposter
% ps2pdf14 myposter.ps myposter.pdf
% Open myposter.pdf in Adobe Reader (sorry, xpdf is buggy and does not
% print large page sizes correctly) and print.  The same caveat
% applies to using "lpr" to print the .pdf directly: CSAIL's print
% system uses xpdf internally.
%
\documentclass[csaild4,portrait]{xa0poster}
\usepackage[noborder]{csailposter}
%
% All of the following descriptive information is mandatory.
% The "left" and "right" authors, if supplied, will result in a two-
% or three-column layout (depending on whether the "" author is empty
% or not.  Currently, only the CSAIL logo is supported, but it should
% be possible to adapt the "csailposter" package to print additional
% logos for projects involving other labs or institutions.  (It is
% based on a package from Edinburgh University which already supports
% this, but the dimensions may need to be adjusted.)
